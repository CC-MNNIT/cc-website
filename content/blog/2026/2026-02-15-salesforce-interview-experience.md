## Overview
Salesforce is San-Francisco based Multi-national company which is often regarded as world's best AI-CRM firm, overall the internship experience at Salesforce is amazing and so is the compensation offered. 

## Internship Pathways
Big chunk of the hiring at Salesforce at entry level happens through PPO conversions post summer internship. There are two ways to land an internship at Salesforce:

1. **On-campus**: Salesforce visits MNNIT Allahabad for summer internship, th process involves an online round (OA) followed by 2 rounds of interview for each shortlisted candidate

2. **Off-campus**: Salesforce often organizes a hackathon (usually called Tech Accelerator), to be aware of when these happen you can check out the [FutureForce Page](https://www.salesforce.com/company/careers/university/) or follow [FutureForce on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/salesforcefutureforce/). So usually the process involves a resume based shortlisting for the hackathon after which the shortlisted candidates are invited to Salesforce Hyderabad Office for a hackathon, interviews are conducted post hackathon and internships are awarded, if you get shorlisted for hackathon, there is a decent chance of qualifying for internships through this route

## On-campus Process

### Online Assessment
The Salesforce online assessment is a timed challenge which is usually organized on Hackerank, this consists of 2-3 DSA questions only, there are no MCQ questions. The questions can vary from leetcode easy to medium and during our time they were based on topics : Greedy, 2 Pointer, Binary Search. The topics may differ and are very hard to predict

### Interviews (Round 1)
The candidates shortlisted for interview go through the first round which is a technical round in which the interviewer asks DSA questions, followed by some questions on your development stack/projects. Usually 70-80% of this interview is about DSA questions which are again leetcode medium at best, the development stack questions are fundamental in nature and can be answered easily if you made the project yourself. 

One of the prime focus of the interviewers is on your ability to develop a solution, to explain your reasoning of your code while you think and write the code, so your best chances are if you don't behave like a robot and start typing and correcting the code, its best if you speak while you code often telling the choices you are making for data structure and why you are making those choices, also tell about the expected time complexity, and even if you realise you made a mistake, point that mistake out and correct it, this shows that you have not just cramped up solutions rather you are able to think with logic.

Prepare a good introduction, usually interviewers ask for your introduction at the start and just saying, "Hi! I am xyz from MNNIT pursuing B.Tech in x branch and I am good in coding" will not be very impactful, so yes that works, but ideally your introduction should be a 1-2 minute quick summary of the highlights of your resume. 

It should be 90% about your skills, projects, CGPA, achievements and interests and 10% about your non-academic, non-coding skills and passion which could be any small mention like "In my free time I love to play basketball/I love to sing/I am a travel freak and I love to explore nature etc. 

### Interview (Round 2)
Be ready to be asked the introduction you gave in round 1, this is generally an HR-Manager round where you don't have to tell a lot about your technical skills where-in the managers try to test your culture fit/critical thinking, you can expect puzzles, and managerial questions:

1. Tell me about your weakness 

Never say a true weakness, you can say anything that initially sounds negative but adds more value to you, I said following: "My weakness is that when I delve into a project I get so involved in it that I forget about food, my own sleep and it costs me little bit health so perhaps this is a place I need establish a more balanced control"

2. What is your favorite subject?

3. What are your greatest achievements?

### Conclusion
So ultimately they will ask you, are there any questions?? This is the bingo moment, you should always ask a question, and the best thing to do it is, read about the company, what are their latest products and what they are investing on, like:

1. So sir, what is agentforce all about and how is this revolutionizing the CRM Landscape?

2. So, I heard trust is the number 1 value at Salesforce, how do developers transform into their daily work, like as an organization how does this work out?

Do not ask about work life balance or compensation, basically Work-Life balance and compensation are already great at Salesforce, so its better to ask for more company oriented questions as it puts you in a favorable position incase of ties. 

## My Internship Experience 
I joined Salesforce as a summer intern in 2025, the experience was amazing, the stipend offered was great and I was alloted the Hyderabad office, the managers at Salesforce are usually really great, and the overall environment and working culture is amazing. 

The office food is great, and the employee perks as well. My team was particularly very warm and welcoming, I personally learnt a lot during my internship, I delivered two projects during my internship:

1. An MCP Server for realtime Jenkins Build Monitoring and Bug-Fixes
2. A distributed multi-threaded priority based gateway service to deliver webhooks to the Jenkins Controllers based on priority

My mentor at Salesforce was from MNNIT Batch 2019 itself, apart from that entire team was very approachable and so was the case with all other interns, and this is something you should do, during internship don't stay stuck, try things and if things don't work out don't waste days fixing it, you are new and the team knows that, so seek help and guidance. You will definitely learn a lot from your team's principal engineer and architects because their perspective will teach you about developing a product from the lenses of the end-user. 

PPO conversions are quite generous at Salesforce given you deliver the project on time, the manager 1 on 1s are amazing and you can share feedback with your team. If you make it Hyderabad office, always make sure to try Andhra-food cause its amazing!
