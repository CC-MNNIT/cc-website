    ALUMNI PAGE TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION
    
    This page uses a custom template (templates/alumni.html) that:
    1. Renders this intro text
    2. Adds search/filter UI and alumni cards (populated from data/alumni.yaml)
    3. Adds additional content sections (Want to Be Featured, Success Stories, etc.)
    
    The template controls the layout to ensure search appears in the right position.
    All additional content sections are defined in the template, not in this markdown.
    
    FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
    - Search by name, company, domain
    - Filter by graduation year, company type, domain
    - Responsive card layout with real-time filtering
    - JavaScript: static/js/alumni-search.js
    - Data source: data/alumni.yaml (single file, no year-based folders)
    
    ALUMNI CARD STRUCTURE:
    - Photo, Name, Batch, Current Role, Company, LinkedIn
    - Domain and company type for filtering
